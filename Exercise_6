1. A stack diagram just before the last invocation of prod completes:
prod: m = 1, n = 4
prod: m = 1, n = 3
prod: m = 1, n = 2
prod: m = 1, n = 1

2. I think the output is 24.

3. I think it basically takes a starting number and an ending number, multiplying all the numbers in between together.

4. The rewritten program would look like:

public static int prod(int m, int n) {
    if (m == n) {
        return n;
    } else {
    
        return n * prod(m, n - 1);
    }
}
